The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to imagine this is if you initialize millions of people equally across all websites, and each person randomly clicks links. Important websites, or nodes will accumulate more people, and less important nodes will lose people. When this converges, the number of poeple at a node would correspond to the PageRank value.\n",

You can think of it that initially, all pages have the same probability of 0.25, and by linking to another page they transfer their PageRank to that site. \n",

For example, if you consider social networks, a community might be a specific friend group.

It could also be used to identify computer generated clusters of websites that try to artificially boost their page rank by linking to each other.\n",
